			<h1 class="Title" id="aboutMeTitle">About Me</h1>
			<p class="Body" id="aboutMeBody">I am a senior at the University of California, San Diego. I majored in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I also minored in Computer Science. I love technology and innovation, the future excites me and I wanted the skillset to make my own mark on the future in this industry. I was born and raised in San Jose, California. My parents came here just when the silicon valley was starting in the early 80's. I was born the youngest of 3 in 1996, growing up so close to silicon valley definitely motivated and inspired me to enter technology. However the main reason I love technology is efficiently, I hate wasting time fixing a problem if I know there is a better way. Technology has been making things more efficient since the beginning of humanity</p>

			<p class="Body" id="hobbiesBody">I enjoy playing basketball, spending time with family and friends, listing to music, and catching up with current events. I like to make sure I know what is going on the world and how it may efect me. I am especially interrested in many of the compnanies that Elon Musk has started. In fact, I have a Tesla Model 3 reservation that I put down an thousand dollar deposit 2 years before the car was made. I also keep up with Elon's other companies sushc as the Boring company that is looking to make underground tunels to ease the flow of traffic. I also am pretty intrested in the Space sector as other companies such as blue origin and virgin have joined in the likes of spacex to make a viable private secotr for space.</p>
